Create an SSH key\\n2. Authorize the key on an EC2 instance\\n3. Connect to the server using SSH\\n4. Configure GitLab to use the SSH key\\n\\n**Key Entities:**\\n\\nTopics: SSH keys, Security, CI/CD, GitLab, Laravel, EC2, Docker\\n\\nTechnologies: SSH, GitLab CI/CD, Docker, Laravel, EC2\\n\\n**Code:**\\n\\nThe article provides a code example of creating an SSH key and authorizing it on an EC2 instance. The code is not included in the summary, but it can be found in the original article.\\n\\n**Database Embedding:**\\n\\nThe summary can be embedded in a vector database for retrieval later.
